Cohn is a proponent of stand-up meeting, particularly emphasizing actual standing during them.[7] Teams are encouraged to come up with their own rules for improving these meetings, for example fining people who are late to them. A 2011 survey of tech employees from around the world found that 78% held daily stand-up-meetings.[8]</p>
